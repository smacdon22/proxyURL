# proxyURL
To access StFX Library subscriptions and read full texts, enter the URL and then paste the new proxied URL into your browser.

For example, off campus this link will not allow access to the full article (https://doi.org/10.1097/ANS.0b013e31824fe6ca).

But after the proxy is prepended (https://libproxy.stfx.ca/login?url=https://doi.org/10.1097/ANS.0b013e31824fe6ca), 
the link will redirect to a login page and with your StFX credentials, you can access the full text.
